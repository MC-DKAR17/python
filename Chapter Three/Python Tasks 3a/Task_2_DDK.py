# Task 2: Square Calculator

# for loop that iterates through a set value of 1 through 6, but counting wise
# it starts at 0, so in reality we only go up to 5.

# This is then the cause for an exponentation to take place for i, showing us
# the first five squares.
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i ** 2)
