The task at hand is meant to demonstrate how a boolean works in a while loop. If this condition remains False, then the loop will continue asking the user infinite questions about the password until they finally input the correct password. Now technically, in most modern solutions, the software you would be using would lock you out for attempting to log-in too many times. However, because there is no such thing in this set of code, that means this will continue asking forever until the end of time. Technically, the boolean also never changes to be "true", once the password is inputted. It just breaks out of the loop, so that it won't crash the system.
